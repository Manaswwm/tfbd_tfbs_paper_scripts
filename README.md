# tfbd_tfbs_paper_scripts
This repository will host the data and code used for making the plots that are to be included in the TFBD-TFBS paper. 

The plots used in the manuscript are in the .tiff format whose size at times exceeds the git file size limit of 25mb. Hence, at times, the plots will
not be uploaded here, they will instead be uploaded to the manuscript folder on Google Drive. All the R scripts and tables used for making the plot
will be uploaded here
